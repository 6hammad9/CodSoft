Chatbot Web Application with Flask and JavaScript

This repository contains a simple web-based chatbot application implemented using Flask, JavaScript, and AJAX. The chatbot interacts with users, providing information about services, pricing, and location.

Features:

Flask Backend: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python.
AJAX Communication: Interactive user experience facilitated through asynchronous communication using AJAX.
Dynamic UI: The user interface dynamically hides/shows elements based on user input, providing a seamless conversational flow.
How It Works:

Users can interact with the chatbot via a web interface.
The chatbot responds to user queries about services, pricing, and location.
It prompts users to provide their name, hiding the name prompt after the first input, and resetting it upon receiving an exit command.
Exit command triggers a reload after a delay, resetting the conversation for the next user.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
Communication: AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)
